***Preamble

M&M was written, aparently, as a reaction to a book called, The Maladies of Memory by T. Ribot, pulished around 1881.
Ribot proposed that memories are lodged in a specific part of the nervous system, somewhre in the brain, and thous memories were of material nature.
Bergson oposed this reduction of spirit to mater, whatever that means. He defended the idea of memories as of spiritual nature, the brain relegated to just orienting present action by inserting relevant memires. "Bergson oposed this reduction of spirit to mater, whatever that means.

The idea that we have disengaged from the facts and confirmed by reasoning is that our body is an instrument of action, and of action only. In no degree, in no sense, under no aspect, does it serve to prepare, far less to explain, a representation. Consider external perception: there is only a difference of degree, not of kind, between the so-called perceptive faculties of the brain and the reflex functions of the spinal cord. While the spinal cord transforms the excitations received into movements which are more or less necessarily executed, the brain puts them into relation with motor mechanisms which are more or less freely chosen;

    but that which the brain explains in our perception is action begun, prepared or suggested, it is not perception itself. 

Consider memory. The body continues to have motor habits capable of acting the past over again; it can begin to have attitudes in which the past will insert itself; or, again, by the repetition of certain cerebral phenomena, which have prolonged former perceptions, it can furnish the action of remembering a point of attachment with the actual, a means of recovering its lost influence upon present reality: but in no case can the brain store up recollections or images. Thus,

    neither in perception, nor in memory, nor a fortiori in the higher attainments of mind, does the body contribute directly to representation.

By developing this hypothesis under its manifold aspects and thus pushing dualism to an extreme, we appeared to divide body and soul by an impassable abyss. In truth, we were indicating the only possible means of bringing them together.
